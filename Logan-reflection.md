* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Before this session I struggled with remembering different commands in git. I would always remember the the majority of a certain command, but forget something small like adding "git" before each command. 
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Fetch and Merge. Wasn't really sure what either of them did when requesting a repo or files, but now I have a better understanding. 
*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked endless amounts of questions. I was lucky enough to have my guide as a pair which I enjoyed and took advantage of. 
* What still confuses you about Git?
Small things I haven't had much experience doing. Like today I added a new repo which was something I haven't done since I forked my prior/first repo. Same scenario with fetch/merge. These things only confuse me because I don't have much experience doing them yet. Once I do them often I will not only remember how to do it, but it gives me a better understanding of what I'm doing and what it does.....If this makes any sense. 
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was good. After a long day of work and doing my other mandatory pairing for 2.2 during my lunch break, I felt a little brain dead lol. It was a lot for one day, but over all both of my pairing sessions were a good experience and I was able to learn a lot.
